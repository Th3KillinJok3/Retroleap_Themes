# Retroleap_Themes

Dark Leap Theme is a custom theme for LeapsterGS gaming devices that run the Retroleap firmware, created by remixing the Dark Switch theme by @alexrwatts. The original theme can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/alexrwatts/Miyoo_Themes.

This theme is designed to conserve limited space on Leapster devices, with the file size kept to a minimum.

To install Dark Leap Theme, follow these instructions:

1. Install Retroleap Alpha 6 on your LeapsterGS device.
2. Move the "Dark Leap" folder to /usr/share/gmenunx/skins.
3. For additional applications, move the "roms" folder to /roms.
4. For added gmenunx sections, move the "sections" folder to /configs/.gmenunx

Please note that this theme will not work with earlier Retroleap builds.
